Requirements
============

1. Dwarf Fortress (Linux or OSX versions only - Windows version does not support text mode)
2. Ruby 2.0 or later
3. **Exactly** one world that is not used by a fortress or an adventurer
4. In `data/init/init.txt`:
  - `[PRINT_MODE:TEXT]`
  - `[GRAPHICS:NO]`
  - `[SOUND:NO]`
  - `[INTRO:NO]`

The Dwarf Fortress path is currently hardcoded as `../df_linux`, but this can be changed in the source without any issues.
